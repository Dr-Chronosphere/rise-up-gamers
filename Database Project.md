# CS 665 Project 1: 
**An Application that uses Database Services** 
In this project, you and your group members will develop a desktop/web application that uses relational databases. _NoSQL or XML databases are not allowed as they do not reflect the database relations we’ve covered in this class_. This is a group project, and it is OK if you choose to complete it solo. 
It is recommended that you choose from popular database software such as:
1. SQL Server Express
2) MySQL
3) SQLite, etc. … 
# Group Formation
Please use the file “Project Group Formation” on MS Teams to form groups. The file will remain editable till midnight of 11/17 (Thursday). TA will follow the group information from the file to form groups on Blackboard. Group size should be 2 – 4 students. (Again, you can do the project solo.) Undergraduates can team with graduate students. 
# Database Requirements (50%) 
Please propose a database to model some mock businesses, for example, Bike rentals, community libraries, Employee Management systems, Service Billing software.
- The database should have at least 4 tables, where each table is in 3NF. 
- Each table should have at least 4 fields (including primary keys) 
- Need to list FDs for each table. 
- Also please specify triggers and policies on foreign key constraints. 
The group needs to write SQL statements to create all tables. 
Once created, please use SQL statements to populate each table by placing at least 5 rows of data. 
Please also have SQL statements to perform CRUD (please place them into another file.) 

# Application Requirements (20%)
Each team may choose their own programming languages/frameworks to build a GUI application for your database. The app should serve as a simple front end to perform CRUD on your database. Also have some predefined SQL statements (such as SQL performing join on multiple tables and subqueries) into buttons to display the result from your database. 
# Git Requirements (20%)
Each member should have at least two git commits towards the project. Each commit should make some non-trivial contributions, such as adding handlers to buttons, writing several SQL statements. Fixing typo in docs is important but should be considered only trivial. 
Create a private GitHub Repo for the project with all members, then send invitations to the instructor and TAs. (Huabo: h72l76. TA’s ID TBA). 
# Submission Requirements (10%)
Need to have the following files: 
1. db_description.md; A description of your database, including tables, attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, foreign key constraints, FDs, whether in 3NF, and one or two rows of sample data for each table. 
2. create_sql.md; the file to have SQL statements to create all tables. 
3. insert_sql.md; the file to have SQL statements to populate tables. 
4. crud_sql.md; the file to perform CRUD using SQL. 
5. readme.md; 
	- the link to your project repo
	- member’s GitHub IDs and names
	- the link to your project’s demo video (unlisted/public on YouTube). Approx. 5 minutes. 
6. A zipped file for your source code (e.g., VS solution) folder. Note that please delete large-size folders such as bin/temp/debug. The zip file should be less than 20MB. 

Due in two weeks (due: 11/28). One-week extension if needed. Each group will make one group submission on blackboard.
